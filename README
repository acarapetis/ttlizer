ttlizer: a simple timetable/schedule optimizer

ttlizer is designed for people who have a large number of activities (for
example, school classes) they need to attend, where they have the choice of
many timeslots for each activity/class.

Attempting to find an ideal combination of timeslots manually is a
time-consuming process that can be automated with a few simple rules.  ttlizer
currently rates combinations based on the following criteria:

    - Negative weighting for activity clashes

The project is still in very early stages; planned criteria for the future:

    - Negative weighting for large gaps in between activities
    - Positive weighting for days with no activities scheduled

Planned features:

    - Customizable weighting for all criteria
    - Generation of preference order for individual activities
