# ttlizer ###################################
### a simple timetable/schedule optimizer ###

## Introduction
`ttlizer` is designed for people who have a large number of activities (for
example, school classes) they need to attend, where they have the choice of
many timeslots for each activity/class.

Attempting to find an ideal combination of timeslots manually is a
time-consuming process that can be automated with a few simple rules.  

## Implementations
The ruby version of ttlizer (`ruby/ttlizer`) is somewhat feature-complete,
though the interface is CLI-only and not very refined.  See
`ruby/README.markdown` for more information.

The Haskell version (`haskell/ttlizer`) is still under development, though it
promises to be much faster than the ruby equivelant.  See
`haskell/README.markdown` for more details.
